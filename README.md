## Task Completion Testing

#### STEP 1: Write out a list of the actions in your system:

* login
* go to register
* sign up
* change activity status
* change date of activities
* go to add activities tab
* choose date in calendar
* add activities by date

| Tasks                             | Score |
| :-------------------------------  | :---- |
| Go to register                    |       |
| Sign up                           |       |
| Change activity status            |       |
| Change dashboard date             |       |
| Go to add activities tab          |       |
| add activity                      |       |
| change date on calendar           |       |
| change month on calendar          |       |
| add new activity on diff date     |       |

#### STEP 2: Ask the user you’re working with to perform each (or a subset) of these actions:

#### STEP 3: Use the following designations:
If the user can perform them quickly and with no trouble, mark it a 3.
If the user can perform it but has some struggles, mark it a 2.
If the user can’t perform it, mark it a 1.


#### STEP 4: Ask 5 different users to perform these tasks, add up the numbers, and start working on the lowest scoring behaviors first. Those are the actions that have the worst usability:

| User   | Score     |
| :----- | :-------- |
|        |           |
|        |           |
|        |           |
|        |           |
|        |           |
